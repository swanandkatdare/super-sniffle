    "A Vector Space , is defined by a set of vectors for example R3 (real numbers) is a vector space , 3 denominates the dimensions (x-axis,y-axis,z-axis) an element of R3 is called a vector and is represented as a linear combination of x,y,z .\n",
    "Vectors can be added togther or multiplied by a scalar ( a real number) and respect the axioms of groups :\n",
    "\n",
    "- That is given two vectors x,y we have the following :\n",
    "    - There exists a zero-element called the null vector 0 such as x+0 = x\n",
    "    - There exists an inverse element -x such as x + (-x) = 0\n",
    "    - There exists a multiplicative identity such as 1x = x \n",
    "    - Commutativity (x+y = y+x) , Distributivity (m(y+z) = m*y + m*z) where m is a scalar , Associativity (x+(y+z) = (x+y+z) = (x+y)+z)\n",

    "\n",
    "- the elements of a span if lineraly independant , meaning that if ax+by+cz = 0 => a=b=c =0 ,are called basis and represent the backbone of that vector space .\n",

    "\n",
    "- The Euclidean space basis is the set of vectors, Vi = {0,0,0,i,0,0...0} where the i-th value is 1 and the rest is zero x-axis is the vector x = (1,0,0) , y = (0,1,0) , z = (0,0,1) \n",

    "**Linear Maps** : a Linear map is a function T : U -> V where U and V are vector spaces that satisfies T(x+y) = Tx+Ty and T(ax) = aTx . A Linear map is a function that operates on vectors **but** it's more precisely a transformation from one vector space to another . (*Mutli-variate functions operate on vectors but are not Linear maps*) .\n",

Multiplication by a matrix A ∈ Rm×n can be thought of as computing a linear transformation TA that takes n-vectors as inputs and produces m-vectors as outputs:\n",
